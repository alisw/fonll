**** v1.3.2 and below ****

- Will give wrong results for photo and electroproduction
  with the photon PDF set AFG (n. 363) if used with LHAPDF
  version >= 5.8.5. 

**** v1.3.0 ****

August 2007

- The large-rapidity problem described below should be fixed.
  (see ChangeLog). 
  An asterisk is still outupt when the result might be unreliable,
  though this might not be visible from the numerical error.

- hdresummed/struv_plus_avgo.f (introduced to fix the large
  rapidity problem) does not compile with the IBM compiler
  xlf v8.1 on Mac. It works fine with g77 though.


**** v1.11 ****

December 2004

- In some conditions (e.g. charm production at Tevatron energy 
  (sqrt(S) = 1960 GeV), small p_T and large rapidity (y >~ 2))
  the cross section behaves erratically. (Thanks to An Tai)

  Cause: the resummed component becomes very large, and the
  suppression factor for spurious higher orders cannot tame them.

  Solution: no fix yet, but as of v1.12 an asterisk appear
  besides potentially troublesome points when using the fonll
  main (and not directly the fonll0 soubroutine). The detailed
  (rs-ml)/mv factor (before suppression) is then output in .outlog

  This problem will also likely be present in previous versions.


- When using the xlf compiler on OSX/Darwin with the 
  -O3 optimization option the FOM0 component gives slightly different 
  results. -O appears to work fine, and the speed-up is similar
